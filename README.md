# ConnectN
Personal project.
The aim is to teach computer how to optimally play ConnectN on an arbitrarily large game grid. 
I aim to implement this using two different methods and compare the results by pitting the two versions against each other:
(1) Computer learns by playing against itself
(2) Create a GUI and make computer learn by watching
